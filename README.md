# image-pixelator
This Windows GUI application helps to bulk pixelate a large number of image files (jpg/png/bmp)

# Features
- You can select image files from Windows dialog and preview these files in application
- You can cancel the running processing immediately (already processed images are preserved)
- Processing can be executed parallelly (beware of ~100% CPU usage, though it'll be fast)

# Usage Aspects
- Saves log in a separate text file about result of processing for each file
- Source files are left untouched (processed files are saved in the same directory as source file)
